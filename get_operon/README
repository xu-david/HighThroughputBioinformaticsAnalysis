I590 Computational Methods for High-Throughput Data Assignment 3
IUPUI SPRING 2014
By: David Xu

DESCRIPTION
    This directory contains the Python code for the third assignment in I590
    Computational methods for high-throughput data. The code was written and
    tested on a Linux/UNIX-like machine running Python 2.7.*.

REQUIRED PACKAGES
    Because of the way Python syntax has changed since Python2.6 and older, or
    in Python 3.*.*, it is likely that SyntaxErrors will be returned if not
    using Python2.7.
    
    The script uses the following standard modules from Python and should not
    require additional installations:
        gzip

USAGE
    All parts of the assignment has been condensed into a single script, which
    can be run by executing the script:
        ./get_operon.py

    The script first reads each input file into a list of lists of tuples.
    Operons are assigned based on co-directional genes with intervening
    distances with less than 50 base-pairs.

RESULTS
    Results are outputted to the 'output.files' directory. Example results are
    also made available in the 'example.output.files' directory.
    
    Operons are returned on a line by line basis. Each tuple within the list in
    a line represents an individual gene within that operon. Each tuple is
    formatted as follows from the data in the original input files:
        (PID, sequence start, sequence end, strand direction, gene name)
