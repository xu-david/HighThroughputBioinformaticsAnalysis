I590 Computational Methods for High-Throughput Data Assignment 4
IUPUI SPRING 2014
By: David Xu

DESCRIPTION
    This directory contains the Python code for the fourth assignment in I590
    Computational methods for high-throughput data. The code was written and
    tested on a Linux/UNIX-like machine running Python 2.7.*.

REQUIRED PACKAGES
    Because of the way Python syntax has changed since Python2.6 and older, or
    in Python 3.*.*, it is likely that SyntaxErrors will be returned if not
    using Python2.7.
    
    The script uses the following standard modules from Python and should not
    require additional installations:
        bz2
        math
        itertools

USAGE
    All parts of the assignment has been condensed into a single script, which
    can be run by executing the script:
        ./gen_pssm.py

    The script first reads the counts matrix and generates the adjusted
    frequency matrix and log-odds PSSM. It then reads the *.bz2 file as is and
	generates the maximum score using a sliding window for each line based on
	the PSSM.

RESULTS
    Results are outputted to the 'output.files' directory. Example results are
    also made available in the 'example.output.files' directory.
    
    The adjusted frequency matrix and position-weight matrix are returned in
	the same format as the initial counts matrix as 'freq_matrix.txt' and
	'weight_matrix.txt', respectively. The top 30 scoring genes and all rank
	ordered genes are returned as 'top30_genes.txt' and 'all_genes.txt',
    respectively. The tab-delimited files columns are provided as the header
	line of the respective text files and are as follows:
		Rank
		Gene ID
		Maximum PSSM Score
